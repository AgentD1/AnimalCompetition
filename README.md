# Animal Competition ![Generated Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentD1/AnimalCompetition/master/.github/cloc.svg)

This is Jacob Parker's Animal Competition.

AnimalCompetition is a game where you configure animals and have them fight each other
(friendlily). You can try to figure out which traits are better. Or you can read the
code to know for sure.

## How to install

Launch the game. Good luck trying to download and run the code yourself.
If you really want to, I developed it using IDEA. You will need Java 17 and probably JavaFX.
If you're sane, just download and unzip the latest release from the releases tab. You
will still need to run it with Java 17 or later, but it comes bundled with all the other
dependencies, so you should just be able to run it.

## How to play

When running, if you did everything right, you will be presented with a menu where you
can select an animal for you and your opponent. Currently, the game comes with 3 (!)
pre-built animals for you to choose from. You can add new animals with the + button or
edit the currently animal with the edit button.

When creating or editing an animal, you can enter or change the name of the species.
You can (must) pick a body to build your animal from. You can then select traits from the
traits box. You can select multiple traits by holding the CTRL button while you click the
traits, or select none by CTRL-clicking on all your selected traits. You can then hit
Create to finalize your creation or edit.

You can then click the "Generate an environment" button to "Generate an environment", which
randomly creates the arena you will fight in. You can then click "Fight!!!" to commence the
fight. Clicking a fight button while your fight is running will automatically finish the
fight as fast as possible. People with no patience, or people who are testing my program
for marks, can press the "Fight Fast" button to immediately fight.

The output at the bottom is where the fight takes place. You can resize this to your
viewing pleasure by resizing the window.

Finally, you can save and load lists of animals in the Edit menu at the top. Clicking
"Save Animals" will save your list of animals wherever you want, while "Load Animals"
will load a list of animals. You can share your wonderful creations like this.
Geniuses can use a JSON editor of their choosing to edit the animals there or even create
custom traits for their animals, which will be imported when the file is loaded.
